# calculator
A calculator for maths written in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

This project forced me to think creatively and push my coding limits. I approached the project step-by-step, following the TOP instructions. This project expanding my knowledge of JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, CSS, and HTML. One crucial aspect of Web Design I learned from this project is to design first and build later. In this project, I first connected my Javascript, without completing the Ui. After, I had match the two parts of the program, breaking the DRY principle. However, I found it valuable to see how the JavaScript worked before finishing the Ui, so a balanced approach may be the best solution. In the end, I am very happy with how my calculator turned out.
